> [!WARNING]
> This is discontinued, I no longer use StoatChat to selfhost my Personal Social Platform. Fluxer has a better Selfhost and i have switched to using fluxer as my selfhost. This Repo will not be maintained. I have switched because StoatChat doesn't meet many needs when it comes to needing to selfhost a social platform. This Repo has been archived

## Development Guide

Before contributing, make yourself familiar with [our contribution guidelines](https://developers.stoat.chat/developing/contrib/), the [code style guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md), and the [technical documentation for this project](https://stoatchat.github.io/for-web/).

Before getting started, you'll want to install:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
- [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)
- Cargo

Then proceed to setup:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web client
cd client

# update submodules if you pull new changes
# git submodule init && git submodule update

# Install some deps, as they dont natively have a arm version. you have to compile it yourself using these commands
cargo install mdbook --version 0.5.2
cargo install mdbook-katex --version 0.9.3

# install all packages
mise install:frozen

# build deps:
mise build:deps

# or build a specific dep (e.g. stoat.js updates):
# pnpm --filter stoat.js run build

# customise the .env
cp packages/client/.env.example packages/client/.env

# run dev server
mise dev

# run all CI checks locally
mise check
```

Finally, navigate to http://local.revolt.chat:5173.

### Using the official backend

By default, the client connects to a backend running on the same host (localhost).

If you want the client to connect to the official hosted backend instead, open the .env file at /packages/client/.env and comment out the local URL varaibles like this:

```env
# connect to local Stoat instance
#VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:14702
#VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:14703
#VITE_MEDIA_URL=http://localhost:14704
#VITE_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:14705

```

When these variables are not set, the client automatically falls back to the official backend. (See https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web/blob/main/packages/client/components/common/lib/env.ts)

## Deployment Guide

### Build the app

```bash
# install packages
mise install:frozen

# build dependencies
mise build:deps

# build for web
mise build

# ... when building for Stoat production
mise build:prod
```

You can now deploy the directory `packages/client/dist`.

### Routing Information

The app currently needs the following routes:

- `/login`
- `/pwa`
- `/dev`
- `/discover`
- `/settings`
- `/invite`
- `/bot`
- `/friends`
- `/server`
- `/channel`

This corresponds to [Content.tsx#L33](packages/client/src/index.tsx).
